#1. Write a function for arithmetic operators(+,-,*,/)
print("Result of addition of 8 and 4 is ",8+4)
print("Result of subtraction of 15 and 7 is ",15-7)
print("Result of multiplication of 6 and 9 is ",6*9)
print("Result of Division of 20 with 4 is ",20/4)
print("Result of Modulus of 19 with 9 is ",19%4)
#2. Write a method for increment and decrement operators(++, --)
a=10
a+=1
print(a)
b=11
b-=1
print(b)
#3.Write a program to find the two numbers equal or not.
c=10 
d=11
statement="is Equal" if c==d else "Is not Equal"
print(statement)
#4.Program for relational operators (<,<==, >, >==)
e=12
f=14
print(" Value of e==f ",e==f)
print(" Value of e!=f ",e!=f)
print(" Value of e>f  ",e>f)
print(" Value of e<f  ",e<f)
print(" Value of e>=f ",e>=f)
print(" Value of e<=f ",e<=f)
#5.Print the smaller and larger number
g=12
h=14
max= g if g>h else h
min= g if g<h else h
print("Maximum value is ",max)
print("Minimum value is ",min)
